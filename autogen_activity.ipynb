        "# AutoGen activity\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of you will have already used Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT or Claude.\n",
        "\n",
        "But there is an emerging area called \"AI Agents\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, these are bots that can autonomously work on a task.\n",
        "\n",
        "They're powered by LLMs and you don't need to give them in-depth intructions on what they should do at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also specify how many Agents you want to use. This  means you can have just 1 agent, or 10 agents working together on a task.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## How AI Agents are different\n",
        "\n",
        "This is different to what we have today. Currently, we integrate one LLM into our products and tell it to do something specific.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's great and has its own use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for some situations we don't want to give it every... single... step...\n",
        "\n",
        "That takes a while to do and requires specialist knowledge from developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "What if we could just tell the Agents to do something and let them work it out?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## The benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several advantages to this new approach:\n",
        "- Easy to setup (under 10 minutes)\n",
        "- Multiple Agents can communicate with each other\n",
        "- Self-improving feedback loop\n",
        "  - Generate\n",
        "  - Improve\n",
        "  - Refine\n",
        "- Using multiple LLMs improves the overall results\n",
        "  - One LLM can be \"overwhelmed\" when you give it too many instructions, or too much content to analyse\n",
        "  - Multiple LLMs can focus on the task from different viewpoints, improving the results\n",
        "- Easy to customise the agents for your use case (Kainos specific)\n",
        "- Provide agents with tools (APIs, code blocks) and let them decide when to use them\n",
        "- Human-in-the-loop\n",
        "  - You can set the agents to ask for your feedback, if they're unsure how to progress\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ideas on how you can use them\n",
        "\n",
        "There's lots of ways you can organise these Agents, but here's just a few ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Code review agents (we will cover this below)\n",
        "- Improve social media posts\n",
        "- Scrape a webpage and analyse it\n",
        "- Brainstorming sessions\n",
        "- Re-write code for accessibility/content issues (developed internally)\n",
        "- Debate agents that argue over a topic\n"

            "\n",
            "The provided Flask application code has several security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability**: The code directly uses the filename provided by the user (`file.filename`) to save the file on the server. This can lead to a security risk where an attacker could upload a malicious file with a crafted filename designed to overwrite critical files or execute arbitrary code.\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Fix**: Sanitize the filename to ensure it does not contain any path traversal characters or other potentially dangerous inputs. Use a secure method to generate or sanitize filenames, such as using a hash or maintaining a strict whitelist of allowed characters.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Directory Traversal/Path Traversal Attack**: By directly appending the user-provided filename to a base directory, the application is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. An attacker could potentially provide a filename like `../../../etc/passwd` to read or overwrite files outside the intended directory.\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Fix**: Validate or sanitize the filename to prevent directory traversal. One approach is to strip out characters like `../` or use libraries like `os.path` to securely join paths and check if the resulting path is within the intended directory.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Lack of File Type Validation**: The application does not check the type of the files being uploaded. This can lead to the upload of potentially executable or harmful files, which could be used to deploy malware or scripts that could be executed on the server or by other users.\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Fix**: Implement file type validation based on MIME type or file extensions to restrict uploads to safe file types.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Running with Debug Mode Enabled**: The application is set to run with `debug=True`, which can expose detailed error information and interactive debuggers to users. This should not be enabled in a production environment as it can leak sensitive information about the application and its environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Fix**: Ensure that debug mode is disabled in production environments. This can be managed by setting an environment variable or a configuration setting that checks the deployment environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Lack of Upload Size Limitation**: The code does not enforce any limits on the size of the file being uploaded. This can lead to denial-of-service attacks where the server's storage or memory is exhausted by very large files.\n",
            "\n",
            "   **Fix**: Set a maximum file size limit using Flask configurations like `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Insecure Storage Location**: Files are being saved to a directory (`/uploads/`) that is not specified. Depending on the server configuration, this directory might be accessible from the web, which could expose uploaded files publicly.\n",
            "\n",

            "1. **File Saving Process**:\n",
            "   - The process of saving a file directly in the route handler can be inefficient, especially if the file size is large or if the server handles multiple requests simultaneously.\n",
            "   - **Optimization**: Consider handling file saving asynchronously or offloading it to a background task using solutions like Celery. This would free up the application to handle more incoming requests while the files are being processed in the background.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **File Path Concatenation**:\n",
            "   - Using string concatenation for file paths (`\"/uploads/\" + filename`) is not only a security risk but can also lead to performance issues if not handled correctly, especially with a large number of file operations.\n",
            "   - **Optimization**: Use `os.path.join()` for constructing file paths. It is optimized for different OS path rules and is generally more efficient and safer.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Repeated Access to Configuration or Environmental Variables**:\n",
            "   - If the application frequently accesses configurations or environment variables (like upload paths or debug flags), it can slightly degrade performance.\n",
            "   - **Optimization**: Cache these values or store them in application context after the first load to avoid repeated access costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Debug Mode**:\n",
            "   - Running Flask in debug mode (`app.run(debug=True)`) is useful for development but can significantly degrade performance in production due to the additional logging and overhead of the debugger.\n",
            "   - **Optimization**: Ensure that debug mode is disabled in production environments. Use environment variables to control the debug mode setting dynamically.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Static File Handling**:\n",
            "   - If Flask serves uploaded files or static content, it can be less efficient compared to dedicated web servers like Nginx or Apache.\n",
            "   - **Optimization**: Offload static file serving to a web server or a content delivery network (CDN) to improve response times and reduce the load on the Flask application.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Resource Allocation**:\n",
            "   - The default Flask server is not designed for high concurrency and can become a bottleneck under heavy load.\n",
            "   - **Optimization**: Use a more robust WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI that supports multiple workers and threads for handling requests. This can significantly improve the application's ability to handle concurrent requests.\n",

This can lead to a security risk where an attacker could upload a malicious file with a crafted filename designed to overwrite critical files or execute arbitrary code.\\n\\n   **Fix**: Sanitize the filename to ensure it does not contain any path traversal characters or other potentially dangerous inputs. Use a secure method to generate or sanitize filenames, such as using a hash or maintaining a strict whitelist of allowed characters.\\n\\n2. **Directory Traversal/Path Traversal Attack**: By directly appending the user-provided filename to a base directory, the application is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. An attacker could potentially provide a filename like `../../../etc/passwd` to read or overwrite files outside the intended directory.\\n\\n   **Fix**: Validate or sanitize the filename to prevent directory traversal. One approach is to strip out characters like `../` or use libraries like `os.path` to securely join paths and check if the resulting path is within the intended directory.\\n\\n3. **Lack of File Type Validation**: The application does not check the type of the files being uploaded. This can lead to the upload of potentially executable or harmful files, which could be used to deploy malware or scripts that could be executed on the server or by other users.\\n\\n   **Fix**: Implement file type validation based on MIME type or file extensions to restrict uploads to safe file types.\\n\\n4. **Running with Debug Mode Enabled**: The application is set to run with `debug=True`, which can expose detailed error information and interactive debuggers to users. This should not be enabled in a production environment as it can leak sensitive information about the application and its environment.\\n\\n   **Fix**: Ensure that debug mode is disabled in production environments. This can be managed by setting an environment variable or a configuration setting that checks the deployment environment.\\n\\n5. **Lack of Upload Size Limitation**: The code does not enforce any limits on the size of the file being uploaded. This can lead to denial-of-service attacks where the server's storage or memory is exhausted by very large files.\\n\\n   **Fix**: Set a maximum file size limit using Flask configurations like `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`.\\n\\n6. **Insecure Storage Location**: Files are being saved to a directory (`/uploads/`) that is not specified. Depending on the server configuration, this directory might be accessible from the web, which could expose uploaded files publicly.\\n\\n   **Fix**: Ensure that uploaded files are stored in a secure location that is not directly accessible via the web. Use server configurations to protect such directories.\\n\\nBy addressing these vulnerabilities, the security of the Flask application can be significantly improved.\", 'name': 'Security_Analyser', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'The security analysis provided is comprehensive and highlights critical vulnerabilities in the Flask application code. Here are some specific code changes and enhancements that can be implemented to address the identified issues:\\n\\n1. **Sanitize Filename**:\\n   ```python\\n   from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename\\n\\n   @app.route(\\'/upload\\', methods=[\\'POST\\'])\\n   def file_upload():\\n       file = flask.request.files[\\'file\\']\\n       filename = secure_filename(file.filename)\\n   ```\\n\\n   Using `secure_filename` from Werkzeug (which is part of Flask\\'s underlying toolkit) ensures that the filename is safe from directory traversal or other malicious manipulations.\\n\\n2. **Validate File Path**:\\n   ```python\\n   import os\\n\\n   UPLOAD_FOLDER = \\'/path/to/uploads\\'\\n   app.config[\\'UPLOAD_FOLDER\\'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER\\n\\n   file_path = os.path.join(app.config[\\'UPLOAD_FOLDER\\'], filename)\\n   if not os.path.abspath(file_path).startswith(UPLOAD_FOLDER):\\n       return \"Invalid file path\", 400\\n   ```\\n\\n   This code ensures that the file path is within the designated upload folder, preventing directory traversal attacks.\\n\\n3. **File Type Validation**:\\n   ```python\\n   ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {\\'txt\\', \\'pdf\\', \\'png\\', \\'jpg\\', \\'jpeg\\', \\'gif\\'}\\n\\n   def allowed_file(filename):\\n       return \\'.\\' in filename and filename.rsplit(\\'.\\', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS\\n\\n   if not allowed_file(filename):\\n       return \"File type not allowed\", 400\\n   ```\\n\\n   This function checks the file extension before saving it, ensuring only allowed file types are uploaded.\\n\\n4. **Disable Debug Mode in Production**:\\n   ```python\\n   if __name__ == \\'__main__\\':\\n       app.run(debug=False)\\n   ```\\n\\n   Ensure that the `debug` mode is turned off when deploying the application to production. This can be further controlled by environment variables to toggle the debug mode as needed.\\n\\n5. **Limit Upload Size**:\\n   ```python\\n   app.config[\\'MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH\\'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024  # 16 megabytes\\n   ```\\n\\n   This Flask configuration limits the size of uploads, protecting the server from denial-of-service attacks involving large files.\\n\\n6. **Secure Storage Location**:\\n   Ensure that the `/path/to/uploads` is correctly configured on the server to prevent direct access from the web. This might involve configuring server rules to deny web access to the upload directory.\\n\\nBy implementing these changes, the application will be more secure against common vulnerabilities associated with file uploads in web applications.', 'name': 'Bug_Detector', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'The code provided for the Flask application handling file uploads has several performance-related issues that can be optimized:\\n\\n1. **File Saving Process**:\\n   - The process of saving a file directly in the route handler can be inefficient, especially if the file size is large or if the server handles multiple requests simultaneously.\\n   - **Optimization**: Consider handling file saving asynchronously or offloading it to a background task using solutions like Celery. This would free up the application to handle more incoming requests while the files are being processed in the background.\\n\\n2. **File Path Concatenation**:\\n   - Using string concatenation for file paths (`\"/uploads/\" + filename`) is not only a security risk but can also lead to performance issues if not handled correctly, especially with a large number of file operations.\\n   - **Optimization**: Use `os.path.join()` for constructing file paths. It is optimized for different OS path rules and is generally more efficient and safer.\\n\\n3. **Repeated Access to Configuration or Environmental Variables**:\\n   - If the application frequently accesses configurations or environment variables (like upload paths or debug flags), it can slightly degrade performance.\\n   - **Optimization**: Cache these values or store them in application context after the first load to avoid repeated access costs.\\n\\n4. **Debug Mode**:\\n   - Running Flask in debug mode (`app.run(debug=True)`) is useful for development but can significantly degrade performance in production due to the additional logging and overhead of the debugger.\\n   - **Optimization**: Ensure that debug mode is disabled in production environments. Use environment variables to control the debug mode setting dynamically.\\n\\n5. **Static File Handling**:\\n   - If Flask serves uploaded files or static content, it can be less efficient compared to dedicated web servers like Nginx or Apache.\\n   - **Optimization**: Offload static file serving to a web server or a content delivery network (CDN) to improve response times and reduce the load on the Flask application.\\n\\n6. **Resource Allocation**:\\n   - The default Flask server is not designed for high concurrency and can become a bottleneck under heavy load.\\n   - **Optimization**: Use a more robust WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI that supports multiple workers and threads for handling requests. This can significantly improve the application\\'s ability to handle concurrent requests.\\n\\nBy addressing these performance issues, the Flask application can handle file uploads more efficiently and scale better under increased loads.', 'name': 'Performance_Analyser', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'The code provided for the Flask application is functional but lacks adequate documentation. Here are specific areas where documentation can be improved:\\n\\n1. **Module and Import Comments**:\\n   - The code begins with imports of `flask` and `os` but does not explain why these modules are necessary. \\n   - **Recommendation**: Add comments above the imports to explain their purpose.
